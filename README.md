# E-food-hub-POS-system
It is a basic POS system web application for restaurants and cafes. In this , I have used bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  and little bit of local storage. I want to make it available offline using service worker, manifest.json and database-syncing between mysql &amp; IndexedDB  and also to make it progressive, so anyone can use it  on any platform.
